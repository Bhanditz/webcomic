- Fixed "arrar" error
- Fixed "This is a comic category" message showing up for non-comic categories
  on the Edit Category page.
- *New* Thanks to improvements in WordPress core and the removal of some
  now-unnecessary validations Chapter names no longer have to be unique across
  all series. You can now have chapters and volumes with the same names in the
  same series or different series.

## [2.1] (2009-07-19)

- Settings page updates:
  - **New** Buffer Alert. When enabled, Webcomic will send an e-mail reminder
    the specified number of days prior to any comic buffer running out.
  - **New** Keyboard Shortcuts. When enabled, users can quickly browser a comic
    series using the left and right arrow keys to see the previous or next
    comic. The key combinations shift+left, shift+right, and shift+down take
    users to the first, last, or a random comic in the series, respectively.
  - A small donate link has been added next to the Webcomic version information.
  - Slight reorganization for easier use. Save posts as drafts, Fallback
    Matching, and ComicPress Compatibility options have been removed.
- Library page updates:
  - **New** Screen Options. Users can now toggle displaying the collection,
    comments, and date columns, as well as set the number of comics listed per
    page.
  - **New** Grid View for Orphan Files. When Thumbnail view is selected
    orphaned files are now displayed in a more practical grid view.
  - **New** Bulk Actions for Orphan Files. Delete, Rename, and Generate Post
    functions have been merged into a new Bulk Actions dropdown for orphan
    files.
  - Post options now provide a Publish dropdown that allows you to save posts
    as drafts on a case-by-case basis. Date and time options are now hidden
    unless an appropriate publish option is selected.
  - Slight reorganization for easier use. Author information has been merged
    into the Post column and replaced with a Comments column.
- Chapters page updates:
  - "How to Use Chapters" instructions have been replaced with a link to the
    Chapters documentation.
- Metabox updates:
  - **New** Orphan File Selector. The metabox now provides a list of orphan
    files that can be easily assigned to a comic post without any associated
    comic file.
- Core updates:
  - **New** Embed Formats. A new 'format' parameter on the_comic_embed()
    allows you to specify whether embed code should be output in standard
    html or bbcode.
  - **New** Navigation Bookends. A new 'bookend' parameter on the comic
    navigation template tags allows you to define a beginning and ending static
    page (or post) that users will be sent to when the click first/previous on
    the first comic or next/last on the last comic.
  - **New** Transcript Backups. Webcomic now saves a transcript backup when an
    "improved" transcript is submitted by a user that can be restored if the
    original transcript is preferred.
  - **New** Template tags: get_comic_buffer, the_comic_buffer,
    the_comic_series. the_comic_embed has a new format option which allows you
    to specify HTML or BBCode output. The parameter order of the chapter
    navigation template tags has changed, and the shortcut nav functions now
    accept only a single $args parameter. get_the_comic() no longer returns
    false when a comic file can't be found, but the 'file' property is set to
    false.
  - **New** Comic Buffer Widget. Allows you to display the total number of
    buffer comics for a particular series, or the date or date and time the
    buffer for a series will run out.
  - **New** Widget Updates. All widgets have been updated to use the WP_Widgets
    class, enabling multi-widget use on all Webcomic widgets.
  - **New** CSS Filters. Webcomic now adds comic-specific CSS classes to both
    the body_class and post_class template tags.
  - Webcomic now automatically performs Fallback Matching based on post dates,
    slugs, and custom fields as necessary. Custom date formats have been
    removed; the format is always YYYY-MM-DD unless an alternate format can be
    found from a previous version of Webcomic, ComicPress Manager, or stripShow.
  - Internal 1.x to 2 upgrade functions have been removed. Users may still be
    able to upgrade directly from Webcomic 1.x to 2.1, though certain settings
    will be reset to their defaults.

- `random_comic()` is now deprecated; use `random_comic_link()` instead.

  on a single WordPress installation, each with it's own Library and Chapter
  hierarchy. All Webcomic features and functions now fully support more than

    images).
- All core functions have been rewritten to improve performance and add new
  features. Please check the Webcomic Codex for fully updated documentation.
  - get_the_comic() now returns an array of comic related information instead

  - get_the_chapter() can now provide both chapter and volume information
    (deprecated get_the_volume(); use get_the_chapter('volume') instead).

  page and add custom descriptions, transcripts, and filenames. Thanks to
  Andrew Naylor for inspiring this addition with his original modifications.
- Includes new permission scheme. Webcomic permissions now check for specific
  user capabilities instead of limiting all plugin access to site
  administrators. WordPress Author's now have access to a limited Comic Library
  and WordPress Editor's now have access to the full Comic Library and Comic
  Chapters.

  regenerate individual comic thumbnails, delete comic posts, and now compares
  filenames during upload to prevent accidental overwrites (with a new option
    to force overwriting an existing file).
- Includes enhanced auto post. Automatic post creation is now compatible with
  all file name options. When enabled, new options to set (or override for the
  Date naming option) the publish datetime for the generated comic post are

  compatible with all file name options. New options to set (or override for
  the Date naming option) the publish datetime and interval (Post every week

  available.
- Includes internationalization support. Webcomic now makes full use of
  WordPress's I18n features to allow for localization.
- The library view option is now set per-user instead of globally. If you're
  using the thumbnail view when you upgrade your view will initially be reset
  to the list view.

  custom descriptions from showing up when searching for more than one term.

  revisions, autosaves, etc.
- Fixed code to set the total page count for Volumes.

## [1.2] (2008-12-19)

- Includes Automatic Post Creation. When enabled, Webcomic will attempt to
  create a new comic post during upload. This option is available when using
  the Date name format with comics that have date information (and nothing
  else) in their filename.
- Added Generate Missing Posts option to the Library page. Webcomic will
  attempt to create comic posts for orphaned comics when activated. This option
  is available when using the Date name format with comics that have date
  information (and nothing else) in their filename.
- Added a validation check to custom date names. Webcomic now checks to make
  sure you have (at least) a year, month, and day or week PHP date string
  identifier and resets to the default date format if one or more of these is
  missing.
- Rewrote most of the Webcomic functions to add features and improve
  performance.
- Includes new template tags: get_the_chapter and get_the_volume.

## [1.1] (2008-12-11)

- Includes Secure option for filenames. When enabled, Webcomic appends a secure
  hash to comic filenames during upload to prevent read-ahead and archive
  scraping.
- Corrected the Markdown plugin error that prevented WordPress from
  automatically activating Webcomic.
