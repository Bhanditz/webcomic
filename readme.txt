_**Everything!**_ Webcomic has been rebuilt to provide you with leaner, meaner webcomic management. Highlights include:

- [OpenGraph](//ogp.me) support for any Webcomic-related page.
- [Twitter](//twitter.com) integration for automatically tweeting new webcomics.
- File management handled through the WordPress Media Library.
- Each collection is now a custom post type with unique storyline and character taxonomies.
- More collection-specific settings provide greater control over each webcomic on your site.
- Transcripts are now a custom post type, taking full advantage of the administrative features WordPress provides.
- Improved theme integration makes it easier than ever to start using Webcomic right away with almost any WordPress theme.
- New and refactored template tags, widgets, and shortcodes for greater control and customization of your Webcomic-powered site.
