Before you dive in to this user guide, take a moment to find the **Help** tab
in the WordPress dashboard. It doesn't appear on every screen, but every
Webcomic screen includes a Help tab filled with screen-specific information and
links to other resources. Whenever you need help, check there first.

When you're ready, click on the **Untitled Comic** link in the sidebar.
