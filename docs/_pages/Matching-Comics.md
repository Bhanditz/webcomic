This is the **Webcomic Matcher** screen, a tool Webcomic provides that can
assign uploaded media to existing comics.

## Matcher settings

Using the Webcomic Matcher is a two-step process. First, you'll want adjust the
settings described below and click **Find Matches** and the matcher will compare
all orphaned comics in the selected collection to all unassigned media in the
media library. You can save any matches by checking them and clicking **Save
Selected Matches**.

### Collection

The collection to check for orphaned comics.

### Match comic…

The comic attribute to match media against.

#### Date Format

The date format to use when matching comic dates.

#### Custom Field

The custom field to use when matching comic custom fields.

### With media…

The media attribute to match orphaned comics against.

### Values must match exactly

When checked, orphaned comics and media will only match if the values are
exactly the same. For example, a post date of `2017-11-10` will not match a
media filename of `2017-11-10-comic.jpg` with this option.
