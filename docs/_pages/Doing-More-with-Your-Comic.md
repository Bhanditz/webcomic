This is the **Webcomic Settings** screen, where you can control the components
that make up Webcomic. Enabling a component adds that component's functionality
to your site, including any extra settings, shortcodes, template tags, and
widgets the component provides. Disabling a component removes that component's
functionality from your site.

## Uninstall

Webcomic has one global setting – **Uninstall** – which deletes data associated
with Webcomic when disabling components or deactivating the plugin.

For example, disabling the Character component with Uninstall enabled will
delete any characters you've created and remove all Character-specific settings
from all your collections. Deactivating the plugin with Uninstall enabled will
delete all Webcomic data from your site, including comics and settings. Uploaded
media will not be deleted.

Uninstall can be a dangerous option. When enabled, Webcomic will display a
warning on this screen and the Plugins screen to remind you about the data you
may lose when disabling components or deactivating the plugin.

## Comic tools

If you have a lot of comic media that you'd like to automatically create posts
for to get your comic up-and-running as fast as possible, [the Webcomic
Generator can help][url-1]. If you have a lot of media _and_ a lot of comics –
but you don't want to spend an eternity associating media with posts – [the
Webcomic Matcher can handle that][url-2].
