[![The Webcomic Generator tool.][img-1]][img-1]

This is the **Webcomic Generator** screen, a tool Webcomic provides that can
automatically generate comics for uploaded media.

## Generator settings

Once you've uploaded your media to the Media Library, head over to the Webcomic
Generator, adjust the settings described below, select and arrange the media
you'd like to publish, and click **Generate Comics**.

### Collection

The collection generated comics will belong to.

### Start on…

The date to begin publishing comics for the selected media. The generator will
publish the first selected media item on this date.

### Publish every…

The days of the week to publish the following comics. The generator works
through the selected media from top to bottom, publishing on the days you
select. You can change the publish order by dragging the media items in the
list.

### Save comics as drafts

When checked, the generator will save comics as drafts instead of publishing
them. These comics will not appear on your site until you publish them.
