> Integrate comic media.

```php
do_action( 'webcomic_integrate_media' )
```

This action provides a way for hooks to add comic media. It will display
the Webcomic Media widget area when using integration. You can use this to
selectively display comic media, but it's often better to use the combined
`webcomic_integrate_media_and_navigation` action.
