> Integrate comic media and navigation.

```php
do_action( 'webcomic_integrate_media_and_navigation' )
```

This action provides a way for hooks to add comic media and navigation.
It will display comic media and navigation based on your Customizer
settings when using integration. You'll want to add this action to your
theme's `single.php` template if you're using integration actions
manually.
