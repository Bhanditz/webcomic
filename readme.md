Webcomic is a plugin for the WordPress publishing platform that adds a number of features related to creating, managing, and sharing webcomics. Key features include:

- **Integration:** Turn any WordPress theme into a Webcomic site with the flip of a switch. Webcomic 3's new integration option makes getting up and running easier than ever.
- **Management:** Manage webcomic posts, files, storylines, characters, print selling options, collection access, age restrictions, transcribing, buffers, and more.
- **Multiplicity:** Manage any number of collections on a single WordPress site or a network of sites.
- **Internationalization:** If Webcomic isn't already available in your language you can translate it into any language you speak using WordPress' own internationalization functions.
- **Extensibility:** Build your own Webcomic-powered WordPress themes using a collection of new template tags, or modify the way Webcomic works using action and filter hooks.
